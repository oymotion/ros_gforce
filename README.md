# Overview
This ROS package creates a ROS node which publishes raw data from the OYMotion gForce-pro Armband in the form of custom ROS messages -- EmgArray and ImuArray.
These messages can be subscribed to and used in standard ROS architectures.

Special thanks to OYMotion developers for building the communication interface of the python version under BLE protocol.
